      <h3>Concrete Poetry: Words and Sounds<br>in Graphic Space</br></h3>
      <h4>Sep. 28 – Nov. 30, 2020</h4>
      <img class="exhibitimg" src="../images/horizon.png" alt="Horizon by Ian Hamilton Finlay">
      <p class="red">Open (Abre), Augusto de Campos (b. 1931) and Julio Plaza (1938–2003), 1969. From Poemobiles (São Paulo, 1974).</p>
      <p>Featuring works by foundational figures Augusto de Campos and Ian Hamilton Finlay, Concrete Poetry explores how these artists invented new forms such as cube poems and standing poems and continuously re-created their projects across media. Poetry by contemporaries including Henri Chopin, Ernst Jandl, Mary Ellen Solt, and Emmett Williams also plays a prominent role.</p>
      <p>While graphic design’s merging of text and imagery is most often seen in its commercial purposes, for advertising, branding, posters, editorial, and so forth; this exhibition shows how layout and lettering inform literature too, in the form of concrete poetry.</p>

      <p>Serious Play: Design in Midcentury America explores the projects of over 40 designers who advocated for playfulness and whimsy within their creations for corporations, domestic interiors, and children. The exhibition presents play as a serious form of inspiration, experimentation, and problem solving. In midcentury America, such playful design occurred against the backdrop of a booming consumer market and as a counterbalance to Cold War–era anxiety. Furniture, toys, textiles, films, posters, ceramics are among the objects featured.</p>
