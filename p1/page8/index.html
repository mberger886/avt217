    <p>On the way there, I saw Officer Baez parked at the corner. He was one of the good ones. He still woke me with a kick to the shoe and made me move along from time to time, but he was friendly and asked if I was getting enough to eat.</p>
    <p>I stopped a few feet away from the window. I didn’t think it was a good idea to walk right up to him. We weren’t that good of friends. He noticed me pretty quickly though.</p>
    <p>“Hey there, George.”</p>
    <p>I shuffled my feet a bit and looked around for the words.</p>
    <p>“You need something? You been getting enough to eat?” It was nice of him to ask, but I wasn’t worried about food today.</p>
