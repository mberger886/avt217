    <p>I woke up with the sun early the next morning. He wasn’t next to me, but that wasn’t unusual. He
usually woke up earlier and went off to do whatever it was he needed to do. He usually joined
me later in the morning.</p>
    <p>Lunch time passed and I had collected a few dollars in change and was hoping to get something
to eat. He hadn’t come back yet. Not unheard of, but definitely unusual. Maybe he was tired of
the rut we’d gotten into. I kind of liked it, myself.</p>
    <p>As dusk settled across the city, I started to worry, although I didn’t like to admit it. In the early
days it was normal for us to spend a day apart, but over the last couple of weeks we had never
gone more than a few hours on our own. Did something happen to him? Maybe a car got him or
some kids hit him with rocks. I knew that people can be mean. Is there such a thing as a dog
catcher? I’d never seen one, but on TV growing up it seemed that dog catchers were always
scooping up mutts.</p>
