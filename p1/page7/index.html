    <p>I stayed in the park again that night. I could have moved. He knew our regular spots and would have checked them all, but I thought I’d keep it easy on him, especially if he was hurt or sick. No sense making him walk halfway across the neighborhood.</p>
    <p>The morning came and went, and I wasn’t sure what to do. I was sad to think that our time together was done. If he had decided to move on to someone else then I couldn’t say no to that, but if he was hurt I wanted to help out. I just didn’t know how.</p>
    <p>I pushed the cart back toward 25th Avenue. I liked it better over there even if I did get kicked out every so often. <a href="../page8/index.html">The grates blew warm air and the foot traffic was strong, so I could usually do all right on money.</a></p>
