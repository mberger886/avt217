    <p>I parked the cart under a big white oak in Rose Park. Traffic was steady in the road down in the ravine, and joggers were constant. As soon as I spread my blanket and took a seat, he went off into the underbrush for a nice look around. I guess he’s just more curious than I am. I don’t have his nose either. To me, it’s all just weeds and bushes, but he seems to get a lot out of it.</p>
    <p>By the time he came back, I was eating a snack of beef jerky and I tossed him a piece. He ate it, but it looked more like a chore than a treat. After a few circles, he lay down a few feet away from me with his eyes focused farther back into the park.</p>
    <p>We both watched the rich dogs playing with each other while their owners chatted. Every sooften, one of the dogs would look over at us and decide we weren’t worth the effort. My partner seemed to feel the same. The owners didn’t look at us at all.</p>
    <p>“You could go play with them if you wanted.”</p>
    <p>Brown eyes told me that I was wrong. The dogs might not mind him joining in, but the ownerswouldn’t want him there. He was fine right here. I was glad he stuck around, even if I didn’t understand all the dynamics involved.<a href="../page6/index.html"> As I fell asleep, he still watched the play area, but I couldn’t tell if it was longingly or just because it was more interesting than facing the street.</a></p>
