    <p>Baez looked at me and then over to his partner. I didn’t know her name since she was new. They regularly put the new officers with Baez.</p>
    <p>“What dog is this? You have a dog?” “Not my dog,” I explained. “Just spends time with me. Can you ask the dog catcher?” I felt sort of stupid asking since I wasn’t sure the dog catcher was real.</p>
    <p>“Well, the pound doesn’t regularly just drive around and scoop up dogs anymore. What’s he look like?”</p>
    <p>“I think I know where he is. Never mind,” I said quickly and shuffled away.</p>
    <p>I didn’t have any idea where he was, but it felt wrong to be talking to the police about him. Even if it was Baez. Our relationship was a quiet one and it was something I didn’t feel like sharing with outsiders. He’d either turn up or he wouldn’t. I couldn’t force something to happen.</p>
    <p>My unease shifted to sadness and then eventually to acceptance as the days passed. I hoped that my little brown friend was still out there, but I figured he probably got hit by a car. I’d been almost hit lots of times crossing the street with my cart, and I’m pretty hard to miss. He wasn’t so easy to see, and even when we were right out in the open people tended to not really see us.</p>
    <p>I missed our talks and those gentle rebukes he gave me with those eyes when I said something stupid. <a href="../page10/index.html">I had a few other friends on the street, but none who got me the way he did.</a></p>
