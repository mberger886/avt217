    <p>The leaves were starting to fall, and I was sitting on my favorite grate on 25th Avenue. As the weather got colder, I stuck more and more to my grate unless forced to move. The police seemed to go a bit easier during this time of year, even the young ones who liked to give me a hard time.</p>
    <p>I watched a family approach, but tried to not seem too interested. They were locals. That is usually easy to spot. Dad was pushing a stroller, and mom was wearing a pink Redskins hat. It was the little girl holding the leash that had my attention</p>
    <p>As they passed by, the dog pulled over toward me and got close enough to give my hand a lick.The little girl seemed to find that funny, and she gave the dog enough slack in the leash to get close. She was probably only six or seven, but the dog was small enough to be handled by her without concern.</p>
    <p>Mom and dad had pulled a few feet away before noticing theyâ€™d left part of the pack behind. The girl was staring at me, and the dog stood in between us looking at me with big brown eyes. <a href="../page11/index.html">He looked serious, just like I remembered, but he looked happy as well.</a></p>
